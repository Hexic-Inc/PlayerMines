**PlayerMines** is a **unique** mine system that enables players to create their own private mine. Equipped with 10 unique upgrades to enhance the mining experience. This plugin can bring a new mining experience to an old GameMode.

##Dependencies
In order for PlayerMines to work properly, there are a few plugins needed. These plugins are **WorldBorderAPI**, **Lucko Helper**, **JetsPrisonMines**, and a custom build of UltraPrisonCore, called **HexicPrisonCore**. Without these plugins, PlayerMines will not function properly.
